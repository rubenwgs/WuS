# 2. Application Layer
## 2.2 The Web and HTTP
### 2.2.1 Overview of HTTP

The `HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)`, the Web's application-layer protocol, is at the heart of the Web. The client program and server program, which both implement HTTP, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages. HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange the messages.

A `Web page` consists of objects. An `object` is simply a file - such as an HTML file, a JPEG image, or a video clip - that is addressable by a single URL.

Because `Web browsers` implement the client side of HTTP, we will use the words *browser* and *client* interchangeably. `Web servers`, which implement the server side of HTTP, house Web objects, each addressable by a URL.
