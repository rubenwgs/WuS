# 6. The Database Language SQL
## 6.1 Simple Queries in SQL
One of the simplest forms of queries in SQL is to ask for those tuples of some relation that satisfy a condition. Such a query is analogous to a selection in relational algebra. this simple query uses the three keywords `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` that characterize SQL.

Example: As our first query, let us ask about the relation

```sql
    Movies(title, year, length, genre, studioName, producerNum)
```
for all movies produced by Disney Studios in 1990. In SQL, we say:

```sql
    /* Code 6.1: Simple SQL query. */
    SELECT *
    FROM Movies
    WHERE studioName = 'Disney' AND year = 1990;
```

- The `FROM` clause gives the relation or relations to which the query refers.
- The `WHERE` clause is a condition, much like a selection-condition in relational algebra. Tuples must satisfy the condition in order to match the query.
- The `SELECT` clause tells which attributes of the tuples matching the condition are produced as part of the answer. The `*` in this example indicates that the entire tuples isproduced.

### 6.1.1 Projection in SQL
In place of the `*` of the `SELECT` clause, we may list some of the attributes of the relation mentioned in the `FROM` clause. The result will be projected onto the attributes listed.

Example: Suppose we wish to modify the query of Code 6.1 to produce only the movie title and length. We may write:

```sql
    /* Code 6.2: Projection in SQL. */
    SELECT title, length
    FROM Movies
    WHERE studioName = 'Disney' AND year = 1990;
```

Sometimes, we wish to produce a relation with column headers different from the attributes of the realtion mentioned in the `FROM` clause. We may follow the name of the attribute by the keyword `AS` and an `alias`, which becomes the header in the result relation.

Example: We can modify Code 6.2 to produce a realtion with attrbiutes `name` and `duration` in place of `title` and `length`.

```sql
    /* Code 6.3: Attribute renaming in queries. */
    SELECT title AS name, length AS duration
    FROM Movies
    WHERE studioName = 'Disney' AND year = 1990;
```

Another option in the `SELECT` clause is to use an expression in place of an attribute.

Example: Suppose we want outputs as in Code 6.3, but with the length in hours. We might replace the `SELECT` clause of that example with:

```sql
    /* Code 6.4: Expressions in SELECT clauses.*/
    SELECT title as name, length*0.16667 AS lengthInHours
```

Remark: SQL is *case insensitive*, meaning that it treats upper- and lower-case letters as the same letter. Only inside quotes does SQL make a distinction between upper- and lower-case letters.

### 6.1.2 Selection in SQL
The selection operator of relational algebra, and much more, is available thorug the `WHERE` clause of SQL. We may build expressions by comparing valuesusing the six common comparison operators: `=, <>, <, >, <=,` and `>=`. The last four operators are as in C, but `<>` is the SQL sym,bol for "*not equal to*" (!=) and `=` in SQL is equality (==).

We may also apply the usual arithmetic operators `+, *,` and so on, to numeric values before we compare them. We may apply the `concatenation` operator `||` to string. For example `'foo' || 'bar'` has value `'foobar'`.

The simple SQL queries that we have seen so far all have the form:

```sql
    /*Code 6.5: SQL Queries and Relational Algebra. */
    SELECT L
    FROM R
    WHERE C
```

in which $L$ is a list of epxression, $R$ is a relation, and $C$ is a condition. The meaning of any such expression is the same as that of the relational-algebra expression:

$$\pi_L(\sigma_C(R))$$

### 6.1.3 Comparison of Strings
Two strings are equal if they are the same sequence of characters. When comparing strings with differen declarations (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, etc.), only the actual strings are compared. SQL ignores any "pad" characters.

When we compare strings by on of the "less than" operators, such as `<` or `>=`, we are asking whether one precedes the other in lexicographic order.

### 6.1.4 Pattern Matching in SQL
SQL also provides the capability to compare strings on the basis of a simple pattern match. An alternative from of comparison expression is

```sql
    /* Code 6.6: Pattern Matching in SQL. */
    s LIKE p
```

where $s$ is a string and $p$ is a `pattern`, that is, a string with the optional use of the two special characters `%` and `_`. Ordinary characters ion $p$ match only themselves in $s$. But `%` in $p$ can match any sequence of 0 or more characters in $s$, and `_` in $p$ matches any one character in $s$.

Similary, `s NOT LIKE p` is true if and only if string $s$ does not match pattern $p$.

Example: We remember a movie "Star *something*", and we remember that the something has four letters. What could this movie be? We can retrieve all such names with the query:

```sql
    /* Code 6.7: Patter matching. */
    SELECT title
    FROM Movies
    WHERE title LIKE 'Star ____';
```

Remark: The convention taken by SQL is that wto consecutive apostrophes in a string represent a single apostrophe and do not end the string. Thus, `''s` in a pattern is matched by a single apostrophe followed by an `s`.
